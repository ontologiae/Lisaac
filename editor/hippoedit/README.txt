From the website:

  HippoEDIT is a powerful, fast and easy to use Windows text editor, primarily
  targeted at power users and programmers. It has modern and lightweight user 
  interface, which supports different interface schemes, Multi Tab environment, 
  seamless web and help browser, File Explorer and Project Explorer, external 
  tools integration and more smart text editor functions.

It has a cool feature in that it very easily nests modes. So, in Lisaac,
when you use the back tick `, the code inside of the back ticks are 
fully syntax highlighted as C code.

It also has slot navigation for Lisaac source files.

Installation
------------

1. Copy lisaac_spec.xml to C:\Program Files\HippoEDIT\data\syntax
2. Restart HippoEDIT. 

.li and .lip files should now be syntax highlighted as Lisaac.
