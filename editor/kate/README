1/ Presentation

The "lisaac.xml" file contains a syntactically-based coloration scheme recognizing 
Lisaac source code for Kate, an open-source code editor (http://www.kate-editor.org/).
It attempts to detect lexical and syntactic errors by colorizing the code in red from 
the point where the error is detected, (which is not necessarily the one where the error is).

2/ Installation

There are 2 possibilies to install the "lisaac.xml" file.

* If you're not the station administrator, or if you don't want other Kate users to have 
direct access to this scheme, copy the file in <your_home_directory>/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax. 
There might have missing subfolders, in this case you'll have to create them.

* If you're the station administrator, and if you want all the Kate users to have direct access 
to this scheme, copy the file in /usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax as root. Depending on the system
you use, the "apps" folder could be in a different place that "/usr/share". In Debian, it's there.

Once you've copied the file in the right place, restart Kate. The Lisaac coloration scheme will be available in "Sources/Lisaac". 
It will be automatically used when you open a file having a ".li" extension (except if you have set another preference by hand).

3/ Known limitations

There are a number of issues due to the way Kate interprets the coloration schemes. 
So don't be surprised to have a correct coloration even if there are syntaxic errors 
in your source code.

Enjoy !
