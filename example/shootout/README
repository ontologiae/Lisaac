  It can be fun to watch the Benchmarks Game
  but like other games it's more fun to play!

	What fun! Can you manipulate the multipliers and weights to make your 
	favourite language the best programming language in the Benchmarks Game?

	Sure we can, Lisaac should be the best programming language never seen ;)
	So help us to perform better code to bite all other programming languages!!

	Please have a look on:

(1) if the program have been uploaded to the shootout benchmark tracker.
(2) lot of memory are used, maybe an error of memory management ?
